**LINEAR STATISTICAL  MODELS**
In our day-to-day lives, the growing data is playing a major role in shaping and
understanding the world to forecast the future outcomes. The rapid increase of
data across all fields has led to the pathway of data analysis. The importance
of each data has led to uncover meaningful insights, patterns for the decisionmaking process.
The fundamental approach in extracting information from the
data in statistical modeling is analysis from linear regression models . The
linear regression helps in understanding the relationship or association between
variables in the field of data analysis.In this analysis we figure out the different
factors that influence the dependent variable using linear models .Here,I have tried to create models for different scenarios with help of R.
******Introduction: Airbnb's Impact on NYC's Hospitality Landscape**

The Airbnb platform has revolutionized the way people discover accommodations, shaking up the traditional hospitality industry with millions of listings worldwide. This transformation is particularly evident in the dynamic city of New York City (NYC), renowned for its diverse neighborhoods and fluctuating demand for temporary lodgings. In response to the competitive nature of the NYC accommodation market, hosts grapple with the challenge of determining optimal prices. Factors such as location, property features, and local events contribute to the complexity of this pricing dilemma. To address this challenge, the development of a robust price prediction model becomes crucial for hosts, providing not only a strategic advantage but also simplifying the pricing process in this bustling metropolis.

Objective: Precise Linear Regression Model for NYC Airbnb Prices

The primary objective of this analysis is to construct a precise linear regression model for forecasting Airbnb accommodation prices in New York City. Leveraging data from nearly 49,000 listings in 2019, the focus is specifically on predicting prices for private room-type accommodations. The overarching goals encompass the establishment of dependable models for price prediction and the identification of significant factors influencing accommodation prices in the diverse NYC market. An integral revelation of this analysis is the substantial impact of geographical location on pricing dynamics.

**Data Preprocessing and Exploratory Analysis****

Data Handling and Exploration:
In the initial stages of analysis, missing values within the dataset were addressed through imputation, primarily using the mean for continuous variables. The subsequent Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) involved a visual exploration of the dataset, utilizing charts and graphs to discern price trends across different neighborhood groups.

Outlier Identification and Treatment:
The Interquartile Range (IQR) method was employed to detect outliers in the 'price' variable, systematically removing them to enhance the accuracy of subsequent models.

Normalization and Scaling:
Numerical variables underwent normalization and scaling, employing min-max scaling to ensure fair contributions from each variable and prevent the dominance of specific features.

****Data Partitioning and Model Building****

Data Splitting:
The dataset underwent partitioning into training and testing sets, adhering to an 80-20 ratio. This facilitated model training and evaluation on new, unseen data, ensuring a fair assessment of predictive effectiveness.

Model Building and Selection:
Four distinct linear regression models (m1 to m4) were constructed and evaluated, each considering various predictors to gauge their impact on Airbnb prices. The models underwent backward and stepwise feature selection to optimize relevance.

**Model Results and Insights****

Performance Overview:
The analysis provides insights into each model's performance, focusing on R-squared values and adjusted R-squared values. Model 2, incorporating predictors like location, host-related details, and neighborhood, emerged as the most effective in explaining price variations.

****Key Findings from Models:****
Each model uncovered specific insights into the factors influencing prices, ranging from the impact of additional nights and host listings to the significant influence of geographical coordinates.

****Conclusion: Guiding Hosts in NYC's Airbnb Market****

In conclusion, this analysis equips hosts in New York City with essential knowledge for determining Airbnb accommodation prices. The revelation of influential factors and the identification of an optimal model contribute valuable insights to hosts navigating the complexities of the NYC hospitality landscape.
